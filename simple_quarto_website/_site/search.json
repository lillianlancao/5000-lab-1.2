    "text": "Social Media Analysis for Education Trends\nAuthor: Lan Cao\n\n\nBackground\nTechnology has reshaped different aspects of our life, and one of them is education. Covid-19 made online courses become an indispensable part of our daily study. Online learning platforms like Coursera and Udemy are proving people with tons of opportunities of absorbing knowledge from many industries. Artificial Intelligence has also been applied to helping students improving their reading, writing and speaking. For example, Grammarly makes use of NLP(natural language processing) to help enhance grammar, spelling, coherence and clarity.\nAs a generation of “Digital Native”, technology has been an indispensable part of our life, and it brings us both challenges and benefits. Therefore, we have to consider how to take advantage of this powerful tool. I have been working as a writing tutor for three years, and I noticed that the labor cost of reviewing students’ essays is huge. If we can make learning more efficient through the help of technology, why don’t we just do that?\nHowever, information asymmetry might be a barrier between us and advanced technology. We may not have access to the most updated educational trends and the latest technology aligning with these new trends. Therefore, I want to conduct social media analysis for education trends to provide students, parents and educators with most updated information, including the appliction of AI, NLP, etc.\n\n\nQuestions Related to This Topic\n\nWhat kinds of technology can be practically applied to education industry?\nHow are social media platforms themselves integrated into educational practices and communication?\nWhat are teachers’ and students’ views on the quality of traditional education and classroom experiences?\nWhat are the challenges and pain points discussed by educators, students, and parents in the social media?\nHow are education policies, reforms, and government decisions perceived and discussed?\nWhat are the sentiments regarding online courses and e-learning platforms?\nWhat are the most discussed educational topics on social media platforms?\nWhich subjects or fields of study are trending?\nAre there specific technological trends in educational technology (EdTech)?\nHow are emerging technologies such as AI, virtual reality, and augmented reality discussed in the context of education?\n\n\n\nSummary of Academic Publications Under this Topic\n\nFirst Paper(Kastrati et al. 2021)\n\nThe passage discusses a systematic mapping study conducted in the educational domain, focusing on sentiment analysis enabled by Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The objective of this study was to examine students’ attitudes, opinions, and behavior towards various aspects of teaching. In this study, the researchers reviewed 92 relevant papers and analyzed them across several dimensions. These dimensions included the specific aspects of education being investigated, the most frequently referenced sources in the literature, research trends and patterns over time, the tools employed for sentiment analysis, and the common techniques used for data representation in sentiment analysis. The study identified several challenges in applying sentiment analysis to students’ feedback in education. As a result, the researchers provided recommendations and future directions to address these challenges. The aim is to inspire further research and development in the field of sentiment analysis for a better understanding of students’ feedback in an educational context.\n\nSecond Paper(Dogan, Goru Dogan, and Bozkurt 2023)\n\nThe study investigated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in online distance education through a systematic review. It revealed a growing interest in AI technologies within education and highlighted the need for examining AI from various perspectives. The findings indicated a heavy reliance on AI technologies with potential for algorithmic-driven future scenarios. The study’s implications for future research include the need to move beyond purely technical studies and consider pedagogy, curriculum, and instructional design. It also emphasized the importance of regulating the use of human-generated data in AI applications and promoting AI ethics. Developing policies and strategies in educational institutions to ensure human-centered online learning processes was highlighted as a priority.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDogan, Murat Ertan, Tulay Goru Dogan, and Aras Bozkurt. 2023. “The Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Online Learning and Distance Education Processes: A Systematic Review of Empirical Studies.” Applied Sciences 13 (5): 3056.\n\n\nKastrati, Zenun, Fisnik Dalipi, Ali Shariq Imran, Krenare Pireva Nuci, and Mudasir Ahmad Wani. 2021. “Sentiment Analysis of Students’ Feedback with NLP and Deep Learning: A Systematic Mapping Study.” Applied Sciences 11 (9): 3986."
